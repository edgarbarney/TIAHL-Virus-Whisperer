# TIAHL-Virus-Whisperer
A program that I wrote for the removal of a USB virus that is common in my school.
Includes looping chiptune music that I composed for this program.
Also includes a file-encrypting class that I got from one of my friends. (Thank you, Ahmet Yunus)

# How to use
Just get "NAudio" library dll into the main directory (same directory with "app.manifest" file)
* [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) - A library that I used for playing MP3 files in my program.

# Small Information
1: "Fast process" does nothing different. Just removes timers that I have intentionally added to just look cool to my teachers.

2: Exceptions are stored as encrypted files but they just use a consistent key. So you can easily decrypt and reproduce bugs. It's just a small layer to protect exceptions from lamers.

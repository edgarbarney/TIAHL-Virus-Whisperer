# TIAHL-Virus-Whisperer
A program that I wrote for removal of USB virus that is common in my school.
Includes a looping chiptune music that I composed for this program.
Also includes a file encryping class that I got from one of my friends. (Thank you Ahmet Yunus)

# How to use
Just get "NAudio" library dll into the main directory (same directory with "app.manifest" file)
* [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) - A library that I used for playing MP3 files in my program.

# Small Information
1:"Fast process" does nothing different. Just removes timers that I have intentionally added to just look cool to my teachers.

2:Exceptions are stored as encrypted files but they just use a consistant key. So you can easily decrypt and reproduce bugs. Its just a small layer to protect exceptions from lamers.
